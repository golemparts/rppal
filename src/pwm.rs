//! Interface for the PWM peripheral.
//!
//! RPPAL controls the Raspberry Pi's PWM peripheral through the `pwm` sysfs
//! interface.
//!
//! ## PWM channels
//!
//! The BCM283x SoC supports two hardware PWM channels. By default, both channels
//! are disabled. To enable only PWM0 on its default pin (BCM GPIO 18, physical pin 12),
//! add `dtoverlay=pwm` to `/boot/config.txt` on Raspberry Pi OS or `boot/firmware/usercfg.txt` on
//! Ubuntu. If you need both PWM channels, replace `pwm` with `pwm-2chan`, which enables PWM0 on BCM
//! GPIO 18 (physical pin 12), and PWM1 on BCM GPIO 19 (physical pin 35). More details on enabling
//! and configuring PWM on other GPIO pins than the default ones can be found in
//! `/boot/overlays/README`.
//!
//! The Raspberry Pi's analog audio output uses both PWM channels. Playing audio and
//! simultaneously accessing a PWM channel may cause issues.
//!
//! Some of the GPIO pins capable of supporting hardware PWM can also be configured for
//! use with other peripherals. Be careful not to enable two peripherals on the same pin
//! at the same time.
//!
//! ## Using PWM without superuser privileges (`sudo`)
//!
//! As of kernel version 4.14.34, released on April 16 2018, it's possible to
//! configure your Raspberry Pi to allow non-root access to PWM. 4.14.34 includes
//! a [patch] that allows `udev` to change file permissions when a
//! PWM channel is exported. This will let any user that's a member of the `gpio`
//! group configure PWM without having to use `sudo`.
//!
//! The `udev` rules needed to make this work haven't been patched in yet as of
//! June 2018, but you can easily add them yourself. Make sure you're running
//! 4.14.34 or later, and append the following snippet to
//! `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-com.rules`. Reboot the Raspberry Pi afterwards.
//!
//! ```text
//! SUBSYSTEM=="pwm*", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c '\
//!     chown -R root:gpio /sys/class/pwm && chmod -R 770 /sys/class/pwm;\
//!     chown -R root:gpio /sys/devices/platform/soc/*.pwm/pwm/pwmchip* &&\
//!     chmod -R 770 /sys/devices/platform/soc/*.pwm/pwm/pwmchip*\
//! '"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Troubleshooting
//!
//! ### Permission denied
//!
//! If [`new`] returns an `io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied`
//! error, make sure `/sys/class/pwm` and all of its subdirectories
//! are owned by `root:gpio`, the current user is a member of the `gpio` group
//! and `udev` is properly configured as mentioned above. Alternatively, you can
//! launch your application using `sudo`.
//!
//! ### Not found
//!
//! If [`new`] returns an `io::ErrorKind::NotFound` error, you may have
//! forgotten to enable the selected PWM channel. The configuration options
//! to enable either of the two PWM channels are listed above.
//!
