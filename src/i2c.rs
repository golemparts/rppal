//! Interface for the I2C peripheral.
//!
//! The Broadcom Serial Controller (BSC) peripheral controls a proprietary bus
//! compliant with the I2C bus/interface. RPPAL communicates with the BSC
//! using the `i2cdev` device interface.
//!
//! ## I2C buses
//!
//! The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and earlier models support three hardware I2C buses,
//! however only the I2C bus on physical pins 3 and 5 should be used to communicate
//! with slave devices. The other two buses are used internally as an HDMI
//! interface, and for HAT identification.
//!
//! On the Raspberry Pi 4 B and 400, three additional I2C buses are available,
//! depending on your configuration, as explained below.
//!
//! ### I2C0 / I2C1
//!
//! On the Raspberry Pi B Rev 1, physical pins 3 (SDA) and 5 (SCL) are tied to I2C0.
//! On every other Raspberry Pi model, they're connected to I2C1.
//!
//! The I2C bus connected to these pins is disabled by
//! default. You can enable it through `sudo raspi-config`, or by manually
//! adding `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` to `/boot/config.txt`. Remember to reboot
//! the Raspberry Pi afterwards.
//!
//! * SDA: BCM GPIO 2 (physical pin 3)
//! * SCL: BCM GPIO 3 (physical pin 5)
//!
//! ### I2C3
//!
//! I2C3 can be enabled by adding `dtoverlay=i2c3` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! * SDA: BCM GPIO 4 (physical pin 7)
//! * SCL: BCM GPIO 5 (physical pin 29)
//!
//! ### I2C4
//!
//! I2C4 can be enabled by adding `dtoverlay=i2c4` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! * SDA: BCM GPIO 8 (physical pin 24)
//! * SCL: BCM GPIO 9 (physical pin 21)
//!
//! ### I2C5
//!
//! I2C5 can be enabled by adding `dtoverlay=i2c5` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! * SDA: BCM GPIO 12 (physical pin 32)
//! * SCL: BCM GPIO 13 (physical pin 33)
//!
//! ### I2C6
//!
//! I2C6 can be enabled by adding `dtoverlay=i2c6` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! * SDA: BCM GPIO 22 (physical pin 15)
//! * SCL: BCM GPIO 23 (physical pin 16)
//!
//! ### Alternative pins
//!
//! The GPIO pin numbers mentioned above are part of the default configuration.
//! Some of their functionality can be moved to different pins. Read
//! `/boot/overlays/README` for more information.
//!
//! ### Software I2C
//!
//! In addition to the hardware I2C buses, it's possible to configure a
//! bit-banged software I2C bus on any available GPIO pins through the `i2c-gpio`
//! device tree overlay. More details on enabling and configuring `i2c-gpio`
//! can be found in `/boot/overlays/README`.
//!
//! ## Transmission speed
//!
//! The BSC supports I2C data transfer rates up to 400 kbit/s (Fast-mode).
//!
//! By default, the I2C bus clock speed is set to 100 kHz. Transferring
//! 1 bit takes 1 clock cycle. You can change the
//! transfer rate by adding `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=X` to
//! `/boot/config.txt`, where `X` should be replaced with the
//! clock frequency in hertz (Hz). Remember to reboot
//! the Raspberry Pi afterwards.
//!
//! ## Not supported
//!
//! Some I2C and SMBus features aren't fully supported by the `i2cdev` interface, the underlying driver or
//! the BCM283x SoC: 10-bit slave addresses, SMBus Block Read, SMBus Block Process Call, SMBus Host Notify,
//! SMBus Read/Write 32/64, and the SMBus Address Resolution Protocol.
//!
//! While clock stretching is supported, a bug exists in the implementation on the BCM283x SoC that will result
//! in corrupted data when a slave device uses clock stretching at arbitrary points during the transfer.
//! Clock stretching only works properly during read operations, directly after the ACK phase, when the additional
//! delay is longer than half of a clock period. More information can be found [here](https://elinux.org/BCM2835_datasheet_errata#p35_I2C_clock_stretching).
//!
//! A possible workaround for slave devices that require clock stretching at other points during the transfer is
//! to use a bit-banged software I2C bus by configuring the `i2c-gpio` device tree overlay as described in `/boot/overlays/README`.
//!
//! ## Troubleshooting
//!
//! ### Permission denied
//!
//! If [`new`] or [`with_bus`] returns an `io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied`
//! error, make sure the file permissions for `/dev/i2c-1` or `/dev/i2c-0`
//! are correct, and the current user is a member of the `i2c` group.
//!
//! ### Timed out
//!
//! Transactions return an `io::ErrorKind::TimedOut` error when their duration
//! exceeds the timeout value. You can change the timeout using [`set_timeout`].
//!
//! [`new`]: struct.I2c.html#method.new
//! [`with_bus`]: struct.I2c.html#method.with_bus
//! [`set_timeout`]: struct.I2c.html#method.set_timeout
