//! Interface for the UART peripherals and any USB to serial adapters.
//!
//! RPPAL controls the Raspberry Pi's UART peripherals through the `ttyAMA0`
//! (PL011) and `ttyS0` (mini UART) character devices. USB to serial adapters
//! are controlled using the `ttyUSBx` and `ttyACMx` character devices.
//!
//! ## UART peripherals
//!
//! The Raspberry Pi's BCM283x SoC features two UART peripherals.
//! `/dev/ttyAMA0` represents the PL011 UART, which offers a full set of
//! features. `/dev/ttyS0` represents an auxiliary peripheral that's referred
//! to as mini UART, with limited capabilities. More details on the differences
//! between the PL011 and mini UART can be found in the official Raspberry Pi
//! [documentation].
//!
//! On earlier Raspberry Pi models without Bluetooth, `/dev/ttyAMA0` is
//! configured as a Linux serial console. On more recent models with Bluetooth,
//! `/dev/ttyAMA0` is connected to the Bluetooth
//! module, and `/dev/ttyS0` is used as a serial console instead. Due to the
//! limitations of `/dev/ttyS0` and the requirement for a fixed core frequency,
//! in most cases you'll want to use `/dev/ttyAMA0` for serial communication.
//!
//! By default, TX (outgoing data) is tied to BCM GPIO 14 (physical pin 8) and
//! RX (incoming data) is tied to BCM GPIO 15 (physical pin 10). You can move
//! these lines to different GPIO pins using the `uart0` and `uart1` overlays,
//! but the alternative pin options aren't exposed through the GPIO header on
//! any of the current Raspberry Pi models. They are only available on the
//! Compute Module's SO-DIMM pads.
//!
//! ## Configure `/dev/ttyAMA0` for serial communication (recommended)
//!
//! Disable the Linux serial console by either deactivating it through
//! `sudo raspi-config`, or manually removing the parameter
//! `console=serial0,115200` from `/boot/cmdline.txt`.
//!
//! Remove any lines containing `enable_uart=0` or `enable_uart=1` from
//! `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! On Raspberry Pi models with a Bluetooth module, an extra step is required
//! to either disable Bluetooth or move it to `/dev/ttyS0`, so `/dev/ttyAMA0`
//! becomes available for serial communication.
//!
//! To disable Bluetooth, add `dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//! You'll also need to disable the service that initializes Bluetooth with
//! `sudo systemctl disable hciuart`.
//!
//! To move the Bluetooth module to `/dev/ttyS0`, instead of disabling it with
//! the above-mentioned steps, add `dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt` and
//! `core_freq=250` to `/boot/config.txt`.
//!
//! Remember to reboot the Raspberry Pi after making any changes.
//!
//! ## Configure `/dev/ttyS0` for serial communication
//!
//! If you prefer to leave the Bluetooth module connected to `/dev/ttyAMA0`,
//! you can configure `/dev/ttyS0` for serial communication instead.
//!
//! Disable the Linux serial console by either deactivating it through
//! `sudo raspi-config`, or manually removing the parameter
//! `console=serial0,115200` from `/boot/cmdline.txt`.
//!
//! Add the line `enable_uart=1` to `/boot/config.txt` to enable serial
//! communication on `/dev/ttyS0`, which also sets a fixed core frequency.
//!
//! Remember to reboot the Raspberry Pi after making any changes.
//!
//! ## USB to serial adapters
//!
//! In addition to controlling the hardware UART peripherals, [`Uart`] can
//! also be used for USB to serial adapters. Depending on the type of
//! device, these can be accessed either through `/dev/ttyUSBx` or
//! `/dev/ttyACMx`, where `x` is an index starting at `0`. The numbering is
//! based on the order in which the devices are discovered by the kernel.
//!
//! When you have multiple USB to serial adapters connected at the same time,
//! you can uniquely identify a specific device by searching for the relevant
//! symlink in the `/dev/serial/by-id` directory, or by adding your own
//! `udev` rules.
//!
//! Support for automatic software (XON/XOFF) and hardware (RTS/CTS) flow
//! control for USB to serial adapters depends on the USB interface IC on the
//! device, and the relevant Linux driver. Some ICs use an older,
//! incompatible RTS/CTS implementation, sometimes referred to as legacy or
//! simplex mode, where RTS is used to indicate data is about to be
//! transmitted, rather than to request the external device to resume its
//! transmission.
//!
//! ## Hardware flow control
//!
//! The RTS/CTS hardware flow control implementation supported by [`Uart`]
//! and used by the Raspberry Pi's UART peripherals requires RTS on one
//! device to be connected to CTS on the other device. The RTS signal is
//! used to request the other device to pause or resume its transmission.
//!
//! Some devices use an older, incompatible RTS/CTS implementation, sometimes
//! referred to as legacy or simplex mode, where RTS is connected to RTS, and
//! CTS to CTS. The RTS signal is used to indicate data is about to be
//! transmitted. [`Uart`] is not compatible with this implementation.
//! Connecting the Raspberry Pi's RTS and CTS pins incorrectly could damage
//! the Pi or the external device.
//!
//! When [`Uart`] is controlling a UART peripheral, enabling hardware flow
//! control will also configure the RTS and CTS pins. On Raspberry Pi models
//! with a 40-pin GPIO header, RTS is tied to BCM GPIO 17 (physical pin 11)
//! and CTS is tied to BCM GPIO 16 (physical pin 36). RTS and CTS aren't
//! available on models with a 26-pin header, except for the Raspberry Pi B
//! Rev 2, which exposes RTS and CTS through its unpopulated P5 header with
//! RTS on BCM GPIO 31 (physical pin 6) and CTS on BCM GPIO 30 (physical pin
//! 5).
//!
//! The RTS and CTS pins are reset to their original state when [`Uart`] goes
//! out of scope. Note that `drop` methods aren't called when a process is
//! abnormally terminated, for instance when a user presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
//! <kbd>C</kbd> and the `SIGINT` signal isn't caught, which prevents [`Uart`]
//! from resetting the pins. You can catch those using crates such as
//! [`simple_signal`].
//!
//! ## Troubleshooting
//!
//! ### Permission denied
//!
//! If [`new`] or [`with_path`] returns an `io::ErrorKind::PermissionDenied`
//! error, make sure the file permissions for the specified device are correct,
//! and the current user is a member of the group that owns the device, which is
//! usually either `dialout` or `tty`.
